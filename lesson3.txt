When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would create a remote repository when you want to have access to it from multiple computers rather than than just the local one.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

There might be files in your local computer that are more up to date than the ones in Github so you don't want to overlap them. 


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are clones that Github makes for you which exists only on Github but still allow you to clone to your own computer. This is done when you don't have access to change someone else's repository. Clones are copies of repositories that you can make to your local computer. Branches are labels to a group of commits on Git.
